# DevOpsDynamite Group Reflection: Why We Are DevOps

Inspired by the guest lecture, our group reflects on what being DevOps means to us and the challenges that still hold us back from fully embracing the DevOps philosophy.

## Why We Are DevOps

- **Agile Mindset & Fast Feedback:**
  We believe that rapid iterations and quick feedback loops are the backbone of effective software development. Fast feedback helps us detect issues early and allows us to adapt quickly, ensuring that our work evolves to meet user needs.

- **Empowerment & Self-Governing Teams:**
  Trusting teams to make decisions is central to our approach. We thrive in environments where teams are given autonomy, reflecting the principle that “with great power comes great responsibility.”

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  We are committed to constant learning and iterative refinement. Embracing continuous improvement means we proactively address challenges and encourage innovative problem-solving in every project.

- **Psychological Safety:**
  Inspired by Eficode’s emphasis on psychological safety, we value creating an environment where everyone feels secure in sharing ideas and admitting mistakes. This trust is fundamental to building resilient and high-performing teams.

- **Holistic Integration and Practical Learning:**
  We view DevOps as an umbrella that unifies various practices—from automating deployments to refining feedback loops. A perfect example is the **pipeline game** created by Eficode. In this game, teams collaboratively build a pipeline for different customer scenarios, which reinforces key DevOps principles like rapid feedback, team autonomy, and continuous improvement.

## What Holds Us Back from Being Fully DevOps

- **Organizational Constraints & Legacy Mindsets:**
  Although we are passionate about agile environments, established structures and the lingering influence of traditional waterfall methods sometimes limit our progress. Initially, the waterfall method was adopted because “others were using it,” but we recognize that software development demands a more dynamic, iterative approach.

- **Maintaining Psychological Safety:**
  Even though we strive to foster an open and supportive environment, the pressure of tight deadlines and high expectations can occasionally make it challenging to consistently uphold psychological safety within our teams.

- **Navigating Software Complexity:**
  Unlike physical constructs such as bridges, software development operates in a realm of abstraction and constant evolution. This unpredictability requires continuous adaptation and presents unique challenges.

- **The Pipeline Challenge:**
  The pipeline game not only serves as an interactive tool for learning but also highlights the real challenge of creating and maintaining seamless pipelines that cater to diverse customer scenarios. It reminds us that the journey toward fully integrated, self-governing teams is ongoing and requires continuous refinement.

- **Eliminating Hardships in the Value Stream:**
  We could improve our shared developer experience by standardizing tools such as `Makefile`s and SSH configurations across the group. Right now, these efforts are being done individually rather than collectively, and this inconsistency creates friction in our workflows.

- **Making Work More Visible:**
  Although we've agreed to create User Stories in our Kanban board when beginning a task, this process is not yet fully adopted by all group members. Emphasizing visibility and limiting work in progress would help us better align and collaborate as a team.

- **Better Knowledge Sharing:**
  We try to document our progress—either in GitHub `docs/` or directly in the Kanban board—but there's room for improvement in consistency and clarity. As a group, we should align on where and how we document things and prioritize tutorial creation when implementing something new.

- **Cultural Shifts & Proactivity:**
One area where we could improve is in being more proactive. At times, it feels like tasks are being delegated in a top-down manner — “this needs to be done, who can do it?” — but when that structure isn’t there, not much seems to get done. Ideally, team members should take the initiative: check the course GitHub, identify open tasks, and pick something to work on. Proactivity like this really helps move the project forward.

Similarly, when someone has spent a significant amount of time (e.g., 15+ hours) setting something up, it's important to recognize that understanding it might require more than a quick read-through of the documentation, especially without prior experience. Taking the time to engage with each other’s work more deeply can help us collaborate more effectively and grow together.

### Conclusion

We identify with DevOps because its agile principles, emphasis on fast feedback, and commitment to continuous improvement resonate with our approach to software development. However, the path to fully embracing DevOps is marked by challenges from overcoming legacy practices to balancing rapid change with responsibility. The pipeline game by Eficode serves as both an engaging learning tool and a reminder of the complexities involved in building robust, customer-focused pipelines.

Just as important as tools and processes is the **culture** we foster. Psychological safety plays a critical role in DevOps without it teams may hesitate to raise issues, share ideas, or admit mistakes. We recognize that cultivating trust and openness is essential to collaboration, innovation, and resilience. These challenges are not roadblocks but opportunities for ongoing growth and improvement in our DevOps journey.
